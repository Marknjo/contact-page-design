# Contact Page Design Project

## :clipboard: Overview

This project is built to test my skills in HTML, CSS, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It will implement the use of CSS page layout tactics. That means the layout will be built using either flexbox, CSS grid, and a custom grid layout.

Since it is a contact page, the form is validated using JavaScript. However, it is not connected to a server. Instead, when the user submits the data and passes the validation, the thank you page will popup with the information the user has populated on the contact page.

## :hammer: The design of the contact page

The contact page design is created using Adobe Photoshop. Below is the image of the final product.

## :ferris_wheel: Testing the project

If you want to test this project on your local machine, just clone it or fork it to play with it.

See my **[Webpack workflow documentation]<https://github.com/Marknjo/webpack-workflows>)** to understand how to navigate around the boilerplate.
